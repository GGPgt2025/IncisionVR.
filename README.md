# IncisionVR.

## Overview 

We thought about how simulations have helped many industries with their training, like aviation training with pilots or natural disaster training for first responders, and wanted to tie that into one of the tracks Hacklytics has. We decided to take our shot with the healthcare track and create a simulation for training to be medical professionals. After much discussion, we have decided to create a VR simulation for medical physicians who are training, to learn how to properly and accurately make an incision on a patient for a particular surgery. In this beta demo of our program, we made a surgical incision that would be an example of an “ideal” surgical incision and compared that ideal result with the user's incision in the program.
